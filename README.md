UnScripter
==========

An Integrated Development Environment for working with UnrealScript and the UDK.

It is written in C# using Winforms (ported from VB.NET). The port is still not complete and therefore some of the C# looks odd.
The text editor widget is the simple, but powerful ScintillaNet. For icons the Oxygen Icon set is used.

Anyone wishing to commit patches and join development is welcome to do so. Expect first release very shortly.

==========
